 * Room games are an abstract representation of an activity that a room

 *
 * Room games can keep track of designated players. If a user is a player,
 * they will not be allowed to change name until their games are complete.
 *
 * The player system is optional: Some games, like Hangman, don't designate
 * players and just allow any user in the room to play.
