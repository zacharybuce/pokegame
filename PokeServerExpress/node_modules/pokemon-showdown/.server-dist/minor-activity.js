 * Minor activities
 * Pokemon Showdown - http://pokemonshowdown.com/
 *
 * Minor activities are representations of non-game activities that rooms
 * regularly use, such as polls and announcements. Rooms are limited to
 * one minor activity at a time.
 *
 * Minor activities keep track of users in the form of userids and IPs.
 * If a player votes for a poll under one IP, they cannot vote for the same
 * poll again.
 *
 * The user-tracking system is not implemented at the base level: Announcements
 * do not have a reason to keep track of users' IPs/IDs because they're just used
 * to broadcast a message to a room.
